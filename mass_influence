We know that the long term objective of EU leadership is to decarbonize Europe and its economy, 
but what many researchers see as difficult is the decarbonization of commercial transport sector 
(and if the emitted carbon is hopefully going to drop below the natural absorption limit one can 
say that the decarbonization has been achieved). Indeed, with actual battery technologies, 
to haul 20+ tons of cargo using solely electric power implies a few tons of batteries added to 
the total vehicle mass (not mentioning anything but the mass). Where I’m hinting is the possibility 
to see ICEs for commercial vehicles present for many decades to come, in which situation 
the hybrid technology could appropriately provide the needed torque in order to haul the goods. 
Now we know that the major difference (in the light of this particular discussion) between 
cars and trucks lies in the vehicle mass variation. And we also know that often trucks are 
not always traveling on the roads at full capacity, so the hauled mass (i.e. carried goods) 
is a variable, which demands different settings at intelligent agent level because, for instance, 
the way we compute the specific fuel consumption involves the vehicle inertia, correlated with mass.
For cars we simplified the whole thing by considering the mass always the same, but for trucks this 
is not valid anymore. So this could constitute another objective selection criteria at the 
system of objectives level (along with urban/non-urban driving). Please note I’m saying ‘could’ not ‘can’, 
this is merely an idea right now. Please let me know your thoughts on the topic.
