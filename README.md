## General info
The purpose of this project is to build an mini-app to simulate a vehicle fuel consumption, hourly, per 100 km and specific. The project is intended to make 
life easier to researchers in the field of Internal Combustion Engine, Hybrid Electric Vehicles and many more.

## Technologies
* Python 3.8.1

## Setup
Keep all the files, notebook and scripts, in the same folder.

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development

To-do list:
* Get hourly consumption -> Done
* Get fuel consumption per 100 km -> Done
* Get specific fuel consumption -> Done
* Build additional functions necessary to model the vehicle fuel consumption -> Done
* Build a lookup mechanism in order to execute once and get the data as many times is necessary -> Done. API style call.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_
